# Leafo.net 2005

This is the ealiest version of leafo.net I could find. There was an ealier
iteration of this but seems to have been lost.

This site was built around a blog and message board. At one point there
appeared to have been a tutorials and articles section, along with a flash
arcade, but those appear to be gone.

There is also the beginnings of a RPG system that was to be integrated with the
forum.

This version of the site is actually still running! I've disabled access to it
though since it appears that almost every query on the site is vulnerable to
SQL injection. Maybe I'll fix it up one day.
