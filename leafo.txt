The angles and devils alike divulged on the plain of purgatory. The 
eternal battles of the heavens were raught of the planet of Magna 
Mater below. The souls of thousands plunged into the foreboding 
territory only to leave the damned below. Loki was not blind to 
circumstances below, and with a flick of the eye he bestowed the souls
of the damed into the Agate of the Volva.

600 years later, lost in the time the souls of the Vikings and 
Valkyries disperse, and the damned reproduce the land. You... you 
bastard. You sit there in your drunken state as an accomplishment of 
the failure of the damned. How long has it been since you last stirred 
in the pile of leaves from whence you believed to have spawned, right
out of the earth trying to forget the torture, the pain, the life of 
the damned.

But! There was something, amongst the night, a light in the sky or 
possibly an angel. She uncovered a mottled piece of quartz declaring it
to be the power of lost gods, the Soul of Odin. She whisked over your 
fetid body claiming you, you alone were the one to shake the dead from 
their mausoleums and bring about the twenty four runs of creation. To 
grasp the Soul of Odin and conquer the halls of Valhalla, to become 
Odin.

You rise from your decrepit pile, and look ahead. Now is the time to 
move, your soul erupts, now.. now.. NOW you must chose!
